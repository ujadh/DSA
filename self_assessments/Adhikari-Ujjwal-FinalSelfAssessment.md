## 1. Introduction

In this self-assessment, I'll talk about what I learned in programming, especially in data structures and algorithms, and what I want to achieve next.

As i had said in the first self assessment before starting this course,that back in 2021, I had studied the fundamentals during my studies in Computer Science and Information Technology. Things like stacks, queues, and basic searching algorithms. While I passed the courses, the practical side was a bit lacking.

I had also expressed that I've got a theoretical base but haven't dived into algorithm design and analysis yet. The real-world application of these concepts was something I was itching to explore.

## 2. Skills

Before starting this course,I had used a mix of languagesâ€”C++,C#, and Python. Knew the syntax down, but applying these languages for efficient problem-solving was the challenge I was eager to tackle.


During the course, I got better at using basic data structures like lists and queues. I also learned about different ways to solve problems, like sorting and searching. Figuring out how to solve problems became easier as I practiced more. While I can understand how long it takes for an algorithm to run, I want to learn more about making algorithms faster.

## 3. Learning

I learned by watching videos and doing exercises with friends. I also looked up information online when I needed help. Doing lots of practice problems and talking with others helped me understand better.I would especially like to mention about the suggestion given by my teacher to watch the video posted by Freecodecamp.org on Algorithm and Data Structure.The tutor Pasan Premaratne was so on point in his teaching.It was the only course i considered watching and i will not regret any single second watching that.The course itself was a complete package,having broad knowledge about all the topics of data structure like lists arrays and queues.

I felt good when I could solve hard problems, like finding the shortest path in a map. But sometimes I struggled with understanding more complicated ideas, like how trees and graphs work. Fixing mistakes in my code and making it run faster were also hard at times because when we write a code its so obsious to make mistake in the code,and the big challenge is to fix that mistake.I  spent alot of my times just searching where it was going wrong and i believe thats how we make progress.Because once you debug the mistake,it makes your confidence high.I also took help from various open source learning platform like stackoverflow and github.

I had also mentioned before this course on my self assessment on the areas which i need to improve like hands-On experience on limited real-world application of data structures and algorithms and also advanced concepts like dynamic programming and complex tree structures.

Sadly i couldnot explore the advanced concepts as i still was hanging on various data structures and their concepts.But this is not the end as i know dsa is a broad field and i want to have a slow and steady race to capitalize on my strong foundation.

At the end i want to say that I need more practice with advanced topics like graph algorithms and dynamic programming. I also want to get better at using these skills to solve real-world problems more efficiently.

## 4. Objectives
Before this course my objectives was to make my foot set on:

Practical Application: Beyond theory, I wanted to implement data structures and algorithms in real projects.

Exploring Advanced Topics: I also wanted to dive deep into more complex algorithms and nuanced use cases of different data structures.

Project-Based Learning: I wanted to build something substantial for a practical understanding, not just grades.

And after the course i can proudly say that i have achieved 75% of my goal.I am also working on a project on a Spell Checker Application.I,furthermore want to learn more about advanced algorithms and data structures by taking online courses and doing projects. I also want to try competing in coding competitions to get better at solving problems quickly.

My biggest goal among all of these is to appear for interviews which requires the knowledge of DSA every now and then.I am also trying to solve interview questions of DSA through leetcode and hackerank.



## 5. Conclusion

Overall, I've learned a lot about programming and solving problems, but I still have more to learn.As said earlier i had already learned DSA in my previous degree but that particular knowledge was hollow and i wanted to learn hands on topics of DSA and use that in real world to solve problem.I dont regret any single seconds i invested in this course.A honorable mention to the hands on exercise which supported my learning.Furthermore, I'm very excited to keep growing and take on new challenges in the future and i promise to never look back again.
