# Self-Assessment:  Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction
Hey, I'm Ujjwal Adhikari, JAMK student ID ,AC4873. Let's talk about my journey with data structures and algorithms—what I've done before this course and where I'm headed.

## Previous Experience
### Data Structures and Algorithms:
Back in 2021, I studied the fundamentals during my studies in Computer Science and Information Technology. Think stacks, queues, and basic searching algorithms. While I passed the courses, the practical side is a bit lacking.

## Learning Background
I've got a theoretical base but haven't dived into algorithm design and analysis yet. The real-world application of these concepts is something I'm itching to explore.

## Programming Experience
Used a mix of languages—C++,C#, and Python. Got the syntax down, but applying these languages for efficient problem-solving is the challenge I'm eager to tackle now.

## Areas Needing Improvement
- **Hands-On Experience:** Limited real-world application of data structures and algorithms. That's the gap I'm looking to fill.
- **Advanced Concepts:** Concepts like dynamic programming and complex tree structures are still unexplored territory. I am excited to explore these area.

## Learning Goals for This Course
- **Practical Application:** Beyond theory, I want to implement data structures and algorithms in real projects.
- **Exploring Advanced Topics:** I want to dive deep into more complex algorithms and nuanced use cases of different data structures.
- **Project-Based Learning:** I want to build something substantial for a practical understanding, not just grades.

## Conclusion
That's the consclusion—I've got the basics, a thirst for hands-on experience, and a keen interest in diving the complexities of algorithms and data structures. I am ready to roll with this course!
