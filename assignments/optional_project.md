# Optional Project

In Data Structures and Algorithm Course project focuses on 
* the use of _two different data structures_ with selected algorithms 
* and their comparison in the implemented application.

Implement this **Optional project** in the **same GitLab repository** where your other assignments of the course are located.

Implement the following steps in the project:

1. Topic Selection

     * First, plan what kind of problem you intend to solve with the help of data structures and algorithms. This application does not have to be a complete application, but can also be a partial solution.
     * Choose a topic where you can use two different data structures to compare these.
     * The topic is completely optional, but focus on the fact that data structures play a significant role in your project.
     * You can discuss the topic of the project with the course teacher before starting the project.

2. Implementation

     * Choose two different data structures (e.g., list and tree or list and hashmap/dictionary) for implementation.
     * Implement the basic operations in your application using both data structures.
     * Implement an algorithm that utilizes both data structures.

3. Performance Measurement

     * Test your implementation with different inputs.
     * Measure and compare the efficiency of data structures (e.g., execution time).
     * It is a plus if you know how to write an automatic test for the application

4. Documentation

     * Write a short report (2-3 pages) about your final project.
     * Describe your chosen topic and its meaning.
     * Describe the data structures you used and the algorithm that uses them.
     * Compare the efficiency of data structures and present your analysis of the results 
     * Write short conclusion.
