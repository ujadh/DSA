# Final Project: Spell Checker Application

## Introduction
For my final project, I have chosen to develop a spell checker application. This application is a crucial component of many text editors and word processors, and its primary function is to identify and suggest corrections for misspelled words.

## Data Structures

### List
The `SpellChecker` class uses a list (`self.words`) to store the dictionary of correct words. A list is a dynamic array that can grow and shrink as needed. It's an ideal choice for this purpose because it allows for efficient addition and retrieval of elements.

### Set
The `generate_edits` method returns a set of all possible edits for a given word. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It's used here because it efficiently eliminates any duplicate edits that might be generated during the deletion, insertion, and replacement processes.

## Algorithms

### Insertion
The `insert_word` method appends a new word to the `self.words` list. This operation is straightforward and efficient, with a time complexity of O(1).

### Search
The `search_word` method checks if a word exists in the `self.words` list. It uses a linear search algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of words in the list.

### Edit Generation
The `generate_edits` method generates all possible edits for a given word by performing deletions, insertions, and replacements. This method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the word.

### Suggestion
The `suggest_corrections` method filters through the edits generated by `generate_edits` and returns valid suggestions from the `self.words` list. This method has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of edits and m is the number of words in the list.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the spell checker application demonstrates the practical use of basic data structures and algorithms in Python. It provides a solid foundation for a more comprehensive spell checking tool that could include features like context-aware suggestions and support for multiple languages. The project has been a great learning experience, and I look forward to enhancing it further.
